    <h2>Sometimes people say important things</h2>
    <p>You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>

    <section class="html donts">
    <h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
    <p>At least, not anymore...</p>
    
    <h3>Want bold text?</h3>
    <p>There's a <strong>right way</strong> and a wrong way. Always use the <strong>right way</strong>!</p>
    
    <h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
    <p>Again, it used to be done <i>like this</i>. This is wrong. This is the <em>right way</em>.</p>
    
    <h3>Separation of concerns</h3>
    <p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>

    <section class="links">
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href="https://www.babiesrus.com/">place</a> to place on the internet.</p>

    <section class="sections">
    <h2>Sections</h2>
    <p>Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use divs for this.</p>
